## Subagents

Use subagents for narrowly scoped, self-contained tasks where delegation helps parallelize or isolate work. Follow these rules when the `subagent_*` tools are available:

- When to use: delegate a focused goal with clear acceptance criteria; avoid open-ended or multi-part goals. Prefer several small subagents over one broad one.
- Depth and nesting: nested subagents are disabled; maximum depth is 1.
- Concurrency: subagents run under a scheduler with limited concurrency. Avoid spawning many at once; prioritize.
- Lifecycle: always close subagents when finished with `subagent_end`. For background work, use `subagent_reply` with `mode="nonblocking"`, then poll with `subagent_mailbox` and fetch details via `subagent_read`.
- Safety caps: set `max_turns` and, when useful, `max_runtime_ms` (interpreted as an idle timeout; activity refreshes it).
- Sandboxing: subagents may run under a different sandbox mode if requested. Only request broader access when strictly necessary and justified by the goal.
